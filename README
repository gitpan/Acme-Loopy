NAME
    Acme::Loopy - loop keyword

SYNOPSIS
            loop {
                    my @row = get_data() or last;
                
                    # First iteration only
                    print table_headers(\@row) unless ${^LOOP};
                
                    # All iterations
                    print table_row(\@row);
            }

DESCRIPTION
    This is really just a test/experiment with Keyword::Simple. It gives you
    a keyword "loop" which acts like a while(1) loop - that is, it loops
    infinitely until an explicit "last". This is quite similar to ikegami's
    Syntax::Feature::Loop.

    Within the loop, the variable "${^LOOP}" can be used to obtain the
    current iteration count. This is a zero-based count, so is zero (false)
    on the first journey around the loop.

    Keyword::Simple made defining the "loop" keyword itself so easy that
    "${^LOOP}" became the tricky part. (Or rather making it work with nested
    loops did!)
